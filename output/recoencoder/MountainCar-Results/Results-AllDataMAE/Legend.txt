Parameters used for the following set of Tests can be found in any folder of these tests. This tests are focused on
establishing whether MAE Loss is a more appropriate Loss Function for the Encoder.  This tests have been done by using
same amount of Max_Timesteps as in TRPO tests (1000). Below are denoted as:

[encoder_ff_dim, encoder_dim, n_head, encoder_layers] - NumberOfParamers Lr=adam_lr Dropout=dropout Dist=dist Loss=loss

MountainCarDelayEnv-run1:  Delay 3  Seed 0 Encoder [8, 128, 2, 1] - 86282 Lr=0.001 Dropout=0.0 InputRescaling Dist=Normal Loss=MAE
MountainCarDelayEnv-run2:  Delay 3  Seed 1 Encoder [8, 128, 2, 1] - 86282 Lr=0.001 Dropout=0.0 InputRescaling Dist=Normal Loss=MAE
MountainCarDelayEnv-run3:  Delay 3  Seed 2 Encoder [8, 128, 2, 1] - 86282 Lr=0.001 Dropout=0.0 InputRescaling Dist=Normal Loss=MAE
